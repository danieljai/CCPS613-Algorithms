# Algorithms
Algorithms for Ryerson University CIND 613, Fall 2020

## Labs

The lab breakdown is as follows:

1. Sorting and Problem Size
   - Implements and tests three sorting algorithms to demonstrate $n \log n$ and $n^2$.
2. Divide and Conquer
   - Performs large integer multiplication. Your implementation must be from the ground up without linking any external libraries
   - Implement `string` to `int`, big `int`, Karatsuba's algorithm
3. Minimum Spanning Trees
   - Finds a minimum spanning tree of a graph. Your implementation must be from the ground up without linking any external libraries using Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm.
4. Greedy Interval Scheduling
   - Determines if your hotel with N rooms can accommodate a series of room requests
   - Implement a greedy algorithm for scheduling hotel bookings
5. Dynamic 0/1 Knapsack
   - Finds an optimal solution to the 0/1 knapsack problem
   - Implement a brute force $O(2^n)$ algorithm, then again with dynamic programming
